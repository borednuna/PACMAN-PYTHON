## Brief Description
This repository contains Greedy Best-First Search path finding implementation on Pacman using single language Python. The algorithm is implemented on the movements of the ghost to chase the player. The use of single language Python shows high and stable performance. But sometimes objects tends to overlap on each other while moving, caused by the inaccuracy of the tilemap.
